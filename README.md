## Abstract
An autoencoder is, by definition, a technique to encode something automatically. By using a neural network, the autoencoder is able to learn how to decompose data (in our case, images) into fairly small bits of data, and then using that representation, reconstruct the original data as closely as it can to the original. For this example a 3D images of MRI are reconstructed.
